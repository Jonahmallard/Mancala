How to play: When it is your turn, click a pocket to "grab" each stone in that pocket and then place one into each pocket around the board counterclock-wise. There are two larger pockets called "Mancalas" on either side of the game board, these are used to store each player's points. Place one stone in the pocket to your right, every time you are placing stones around the board. You will skip the other player's Mancala anytime you make your way around to that side of the board. The game ends when one of the player's has no more stones on their side of the board. The player with the most stones in their Mancala at the end of the game wins!!!
